# SSS task


### Deploy
It is simple php, just run it under apache or whatever. php with gmp required.

Alternatively: use docker.

If you want to solve the challange properly, look only at files inside `public` directory.

### Writeup
Only important files are: `Signer.php` and `index.php`.

There are two flags, for crypto and web part:

crypto: we can simply compute secret key "x" (which is flag1.txt) from any signature (just use some modulo math). See solve1.php

web - having the key, we can sign anything. Also note that signature validation is broken, so we can send "0.1" as signature for any payload. Next: the payload goes to unserialize, we can exploit `\__destruct` in Controller putting webshell in ./tracks/../shell.php. Now just read flag2.txt
