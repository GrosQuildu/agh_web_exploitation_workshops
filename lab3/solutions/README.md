First try with descriptions and hints below, then check out the scripts.

### magic1
It is the simplest command injection. Just escape `'` and run commands.

### magic2
Cmd injection with blacklist. Use `\` for `"` escape and run ./get_flag binary with proper argument and std input.

### magic3
SQL injection in Django REST framework. Find correct CVE and read `password` and `username` columns from `auth_user` where `ID=3`.

### magic4
Blind sql injection. Read about it and bruteforce encrypted flag char-by-char (one at time). Preferably using binary search. Then decrypt the flag using `/captcha` endpoint.

### magic5
Template injection. Find a way to get back results of the `system("")` call. For example use reverse-shell.
